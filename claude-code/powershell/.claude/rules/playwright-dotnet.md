# Playwright .NET Test Generation Instructions

## Code Quality Standards

- **Locators**: Prioritize user-facing, role-based locators (`GetByRole`, `GetByLabel`, `GetByText`, etc.) for resilience and accessibility. Use `await Test.StepAsync()` to group interactions and improve test readability and reporting.
- **Assertions**: Use auto-retrying web-first assertions. These assertions use `Expect()` from Playwright assertions (e.g., `await Expect(locator).ToHaveTextAsync()`). Avoid checking visibility unless specifically testing for visibility changes.
- **Timeouts**: Rely on Playwright's built-in auto-waiting mechanisms. Avoid hard-coded waits or increased default timeouts.
- **Clarity**: Use descriptive test and step titles that clearly state the intent. Add comments only to explain complex logic or non-obvious interactions.

## Test Structure

- **Usings**: Start with `using Microsoft.Playwright;` and the appropriate test framework package (`Microsoft.Playwright.Xunit`, `Microsoft.Playwright.NUnit`, or `Microsoft.Playwright.MSTest`).
- **Organization**: Create test classes that inherit from `PageTest` or use `IClassFixture<PlaywrightFixture>` for xUnit with custom fixtures. Group related tests for a feature in the same test class.
- **Setup**: Use `[SetUp]` (NUnit), `[TestInitialize]` (MSTest), or constructor initialization (xUnit) for setup actions common to all tests (e.g., navigating to a page).
- **Titles**: Use the appropriate test attribute (`[Test]` for NUnit, `[Fact]` for xUnit, `[TestMethod]` for MSTest) with descriptive method names following C# naming conventions.

## File Organization

- **Location**: Store all test files in a `Tests/` directory or organize by feature.
- **Naming**: Use the convention `<FeatureOrPage>Tests.cs` (e.g., `LoginTests.cs`, `SearchTests.cs`).
- **Scope**: Aim for one test class per major application feature or page.

## Assertion Best Practices

- **UI Structure**: Use `ToMatchAriaSnapshotAsync` to verify the accessibility tree structure of a component.
- **Element Counts**: Use `ToHaveCountAsync` to assert the number of elements found by a locator.
- **Text Content**: Use `ToHaveTextAsync` for exact text matches and `ToContainTextAsync` for partial matches.
- **Navigation**: Use `ToHaveURLAsync` to verify the page URL after an action.

## Example Test Structure

```csharp
using Microsoft.Playwright;
using Microsoft.Playwright.Xunit;
using static Microsoft.Playwright.Assertions;

namespace PlaywrightTests;

public class FeatureTests : PageTest
{
    public override async Task InitializeAsync()
    {
        await base.InitializeAsync();
        await Page.GotoAsync("https://your-app-url");
    }

    [Fact]
    public async Task ShouldPerformExpectedBehavior()
    {
        await Test.StepAsync("Perform user action", async () =>
        {
            await Page.GetByRole(AriaRole.Button, new() { Name = "Submit" }).ClickAsync();
        });

        await Test.StepAsync("Verify result", async () =>
        {
            await Expect(Page.GetByRole(AriaRole.Heading, new() { Level = 1 }))
                .ToHaveTextAsync("Success");
        });
    }
}
```

## Test Execution Strategy

1. **Initial Run**: Execute tests with `dotnet test` or using the test runner in your IDE
2. **Debug Failures**: Analyze test failures and identify root causes
3. **Iterate**: Refine locators, assertions, or test logic as needed
4. **Validate**: Ensure tests pass consistently and cover the intended functionality
5. **Report**: Provide feedback on test results and any issues discovered

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing tests, ensure:

- [ ] All locators are accessible and specific and avoid strict mode violations
- [ ] Tests are grouped logically and follow a clear structure
- [ ] Assertions are meaningful and reflect user expectations
- [ ] Tests follow consistent naming conventions
- [ ] Code is properly formatted
